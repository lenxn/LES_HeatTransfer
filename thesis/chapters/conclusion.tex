Unfortunatelly there were nowhere experimental results of a heat transfer on a NACA airfoil to be found and therefore the LES method could only be evaluated by comparing to other CFD results.
Accordingly one interesting aspect for future investigation would be to compare the results from this project to experimentally achieved results.

It has to be stated that the documentation and reference material for Large Eddy Simulation is rather meager. It seems that the Ansys Software tool are more dedicated to stationary simulations and it became obvious that LES requires more experience and knowledge in CFD in order to produce reliable results. Due to the long calculation durations it appears rather cumbersome and errors in the simulation setup can cost a vast amounts of time.

Nevertheless there are various reasons to perfer the LES, as stated in chapter \ref{ss:comparison}, and therefore it is most likely to become more frequently applied for technical flow investigation in the future.
