Basics of turbulent flows

- all natural flows are turbulent
- wide range of length- and time scales
- three-dimensional, spacial
- chaotic behaviour (esp. smaller scales)
- three approaches in CFD
	+ RANS
		standard
		turbulences are modeled
		economical, easy to setup
	+ DNS
		every single eddy simulated numberical
		tremendous demands on resources
		only conducted for academic researches
	+ LES
		simulation type used for this project

- Basics of LES
	+ compromise between RANS and DNS
	+ larger eddies -> time dependent simulation
	+ smaller eddies -> models (like RANS)
	+ smaller eddies highly isotropic while larger dependent from geometry and flow conditions
	+ for classification dedicated filter functions
	+ high demand on resources (less than DNS)

- Mesh Generation
	+ 2D mesh provided by supervisor, DR. Hassler
	+ extended it in z-direction (3D properties of turbulences)
	+ fine grid next to the wall -> y+ value below one required for relevant results

- Results of heat transfer
	+ graph: x-axis - x-coordinate, y-axis - wall heat flux
	+ blue: similar RANS simulation, received from Dr. Hassler for comparison
		physical illogical at the front end -> should look more like LES
		due to SST turbulence model
	+ red: LES simulation
		features higher heat transfer
